**Owner:** Navishaa  
**Focus:** Seller View (Advertiser / Campaign Management)

## Scope of My Work

My contribution focuses on the **seller-side logic** in the auction simulation framework.  
This corresponds to how advertisers create campaigns, decide bids, manage budgets, and respond to auction outcomes over time.

---

## What I Will Implement

### 1. Campaign Abstraction
- Define a `Campaign` entity for sellers
- Each campaign will specify:
  - Budget (daily / total)
  - Value per conversion
  - Targeting constraints (if applicable)
- Allow a seller to manage **multiple campaigns**

---

### 2. Bidding Strategies
Implement and compare different seller bidding policies, including:
- Fixed bidding (baseline)
- Value-based bidding (bid proportional to predicted value)
- Automated bidding with pacing control

These strategies will plug into the existing seller logic in `market/sellers.py`.

---

### 3. Budget Pacing
- Extend or refine the existing pacing controller
- Ensure budgets are spent smoothly over time
- Study the effect of pacing on:
  - Spend efficiency
  - Conversions
  - Seller ROI

---

## What I Will Compare / Evaluate

- Fixed bidding vs automated bidding
- Impact of pacing vs no pacing
- Seller-level metrics such as:
  - Spend
  - Conversions
  - Revenue
  - ROI

Evaluation will use outputs already generated by the simulation framework.

## Current Status

- Explored repository structure and seller logic
- Identified `market/sellers.py` as the core seller-side module
- Designing campaign abstractions and seller policies
- Maintaining a running log of progress and challenges

---

## Communication & Updates

- A running log is maintained in `log.md`
- Code and documentation updates will be pushed regularly
- Questions and design decisions will be documented for async review
