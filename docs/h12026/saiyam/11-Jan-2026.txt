My Part: Recommender System

Started by understanding how the recommender-system component will fit into the overall simulation framework and identifying the data requirements for retrieval, ranking, and long-term simulation experiments.
The main challenge identified early was handling the Amazon Reviews dataset (~1 TB) in a scalable and reproducible way.

What I have done so far

- Studied the structure and scale of the Amazon Reviews dataset.

- Explored two available routes for accessing the data:
    - Raw dataset from the UCSD website (gzipped JSON files).
    - Hugging Face Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset.

- Compared both options based on:
    - Ease of access and schema consistency
    - Support for streaming and memory-safe processing
    - Versioning and reproducibility
    - Suitability for large-scale preprocessing

- Decided to use the Hugging Face dataset as it provides:
    - Standardized and versioned data
    - Native streaming support
    - Built-in local caching to avoid repeated downloads
    - Easier integration with downstream ML and simulation pipelines

Conceptual understanding developed

- Raw interaction logs are not directly usable for recommender simulations.
- The dataset needs to be reduced into compact, structured tables that represent:
    - User–item interactions
    - Item metadata (catalog)
    - User-level statistics
- A traditional in-memory approach is infeasible; a streaming MapReduce-style pipeline is required.

Decisions made

- Use Hugging Face streaming mode (streaming=True) instead of full dataset loading.
- Configure a shared local Hugging Face cache on a datacentre datastore connected to ADA/Turing.
- Use a MapReduce-style preprocessing approach:
    - Map phase: extract interaction events and metadata while streaming.
    - Reduce phase: aggregate per-user and per-item statistics.
    - Periodically flush intermediate results to disk to control memory usage.
- Store reduced datasets in Parquet format for efficient storage and access.

Planned output formats (for simulation)
- Interactions table: user_id, item_id, timestamp, event_type, value
- Items table: item_id, title, categories, brand, price, popularity
- Users table: user_id, interaction_count, category preferences, last active time

Resources researched / planned to use
- Hugging Face Datasets documentation (streaming and caching)
- Hugging Face Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset
- PyArrow / Parquet documentation for columnar storage
- DuckDB / Spark (as possible reduce-phase tools if required)
- Elasticsearch documentation (for later indexing of item catalog)

Plan going forward
- Set up Hugging Face local cache on datacentre storage.
- Write a minimal streaming preprocessing script.
- Implement MapReduce-style aggregation for interactions, users, and items.
- Generate initial Parquet outputs for downstream recommender experiments.
