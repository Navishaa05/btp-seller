My part : Auction Module 

First understood breif idea about whole project and how Auction Module is currently working.

currently they r using some sigmoid functions (simple neural networks) to predict the bid prices for the ads.

Our Task : Replace the current model with more advanced models like XGBoost...

As i have no prior experience in Auction Theory and Reinforcement Learning, so i have made a plan to learn the required concepts step by step.

My plan:
Phase 0 – Understanding the Basics 

✔ How ad auctions work
✔ What CTR / CVR mean
✔ What budget pacing means

Phase 1 – Auction fundamentals 

✔ First-price vs GSP vs VCG
✔ Quality score concept
✔ Multi-slot auctions

Phase 2 – ML for prediction 

✔ What features are
✔ What count-based features are
✔ Understand XGBoost 

Phase 3 – RL basics

Learn RL basics including:
✔ State / Action / Reward
✔ Episode / Policy
✔ How Gym environments work

Phase 4 - Start Building auctionGym 

================================================================================

Prerequisites & Topics to Learn:

1.Auction Theory: 
   - Understand the basics of auction theory, including different types of auctions (e.g., first-price, second-price, VCG, Gsp ).
   - Study how bidders strategize and how auction formats impact bidding behavior.
   - Read src/auction_sim/auction/mechanisms.py in the codebase for better understanding of auction mechanisms.

2.Machine Learning for Prediction:

ok so here is where work starts ...
